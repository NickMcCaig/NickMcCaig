## 👋 About Me

I’m a passionate Full Stack Software Engineer at Experian, specialising in building scalable, robust solutions using .NET, AWS, React, and Flutter. My experience spans the finance, HR, and public sectors, designing modern cloud-native applications and leveraging both Microsoft Azure and AWS for global-scale systems.

From hackathons, modernisation, and greenfield project delivery to mentoring and teaching others, I thrive in fast-paced, innovative teams. I’m driven by curiosity, collaboration, and a desire to use technology to solve complex, real-world problems, while building strong communities and empowering those around me.

## 🤝 Teaching, Mentoring & Team-Building

I believe great technology is built by great teams. My approach is people-first: I focus on empowering those around me, reducing cognitive load, and helping others discover and develop their unique strengths.

- **Mentorship at MHR:** Mentored two developers and supported software academy graduates, teaching programming fundamentals, best practices, and decision-making around performance and adaptability. Helped new team members quickly contribute to unfamiliar codebases and guided the team through complex features with clarity and empathy.
- **Cloud Modernisation at Nottinghamshire County Council:** Led colleagues through a major cloud migration, introducing modern tools and practices, and making sure everyone felt confident and productive with new technologies.
- **University & Community:** Delivered workshops and hands-on sessions for students, supported Code First Girls, and regularly helped others at hackathons and tech events.
- **Team Culture:** Known for my approachable, positive style, I put both stakeholders and developers at ease. I help identify and nurture individual strengths—so that every developer can specialise, excel, and enjoy their craft, rather than being forced into a “one size fits all” role.
